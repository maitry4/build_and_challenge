<h2>🎯 Project Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, you'll build a real-time version of Rock-Paper-Scissors where you'll use your hand gestures to play
    against the computer. By using <strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>MediaPipe</strong> for hand gesture recognition
    and <strong>CustomTkinter</strong> for the interface, this game detects your moves in real-time and lets you compete
    with the computer.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Real Time Hand gesture recognition for Rock, Paper, and Scissors using your webcam.</li>
    <li>Intuitive graphical interface with easy-to-understand instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Gesture Recognition:</strong> Detects your hand gestures in front of the camera using OpenCV
        and MediaPipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive GUI:</strong> A clean, simple interface built with CustomTkinter.</li>
    <li><strong>Computer AI:</strong> The computer randomly chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🛠 Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python 3.x</strong></li>
    <li><strong>customtkinter</strong>: For creating the graphical user interface.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenCV</strong>: For accessing the webcam and processing the video feed.</li>
    <li><strong>MediaPipe</strong>: For detecting and tracking hand gestures.</li>
</ul>
